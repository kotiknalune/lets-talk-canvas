					Compare a simple spinning cube in Babylon.js and Unity3D.  
					Babylon.js would be a few bytes, load instantly and can integrate with all other HTML elements.  
					Can interact via standard Javascript events. 
					 I use Babylon.js for my hybrid website 'cos I need the seamless integration.  
					 Unity3D takes full page, ages to load, 20 MB file sizes.  However, you could pull off Quake in Unity3D webGL. 
					  Babylon.js doesn't have the versatility to do that yet. Ive worked with several 3d engines and babylon is 
					  powerful and lightweight and would more then be capable of a fully deployed multiplayer fps
					Webgl game need to be "light" fast and flexible. if your are looking for cross platform game, unity is your 
					friend. If your are looking for webgl only and an "optimized" way, bjs is my choice. Games that target the 
					web you have to conscious of file size (as that is download/waiting time) and stability,
					 at the moment the webgl tech from the big players such as unity and unreal is nearly there but not
					  quite in my opinion. Much crashing and instability on every demo I have seen so far and those are only demos
					   never mind a genuine long terms production piece. It is getting better though and hopefully soon we will 
					   get there, but if you are targeting desktops remember that folks don't upgrade their pcs as often as their 
					   devices. Hell my pc could be considered ancient and is still going strong.
